##TIPS FOR USING GITHUB

- Local files can be found in the Documents/GitHub directory. Each new repo you create will show up as a subdirectory of GitHub.

- To push local changes up to actual GitHub website, you have to hit publish. Once you do that, other people on other computers can pull any of your past versions down, and put new ones up.
