These sets of files are for the left side navigation test.  Basically I took a beautiful design for a navigational bar on the left side, and tweaked it meet my needs.  When you click on of the links it will open up a corresponding PHP page in the area to the right.

I like the look and color scheme of this design, and so will probably make this a final design.

Initial design can be seen here:
